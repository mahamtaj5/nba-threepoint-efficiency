## STAT 228 Final Project: The Three-Point Revolution

**Project Title:**  
The Three-Point Revolution: How Efficiency Behind the Arc Predicts NBA Team Success (2003â€“2023)

**Description:**  
This project explores whether three-point shooting efficiency (3P%) predicts NBA team success using regular-season data from 2003 to 2023. I used R for data wrangling, visualization, and linear modeling. The results show that 3P% is a significant predictor of win rate, highlighting the strategic importance of long-range shooting in the modern NBA.
